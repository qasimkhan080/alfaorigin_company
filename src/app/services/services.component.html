                    <p>Onshore software development entails engaging with a development team in the same territory as your business center. This is a good choice when the work requires close collaboration with on-site specialists, and regular face-to-face communication is critical. We offer top-quality on-shore development from our development centers in USA, UK, LATAM and South Asia.</p>

                    <p>If you are looking for a development team to be available in the same time zone but aren’t particular about having them on-premises, having a team at a nearby location might be a suitable model for you. This model provides access to highly experienced resources who possess the same skills and workflow efficiencies as onshore resources – at a better value. The geographic proximity – resulting in better time zone alignment – also enables real-time, collaborative agile development cycle. With offices located at key locations in four continents, 10Pearls provide nearshore services to customers around the globe.</p>

It is an efficient approach to on-board excellent talent at scale while keeping the costs low.

                    <p>There is no one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to software development models. Every organization has to understand their DNA and come up with a right shoring model. In Rightshore Software Development, a project’s origination/company’s business center identifies and follow a blended shore approach, where some key processes like Project Delivery, Architecture and UX/UI may be kept onshore/nearshore, and roles like software development, quality assurance, DevOps etc. could be outsourced at an offshore location.</p>
